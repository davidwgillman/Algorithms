5. To figure out the rate of growth, I took graph1.png and put it into log scale (look at graph2.png). From this graph, we can see that when in log scale, the trends are linear for both BST and Red Black BST. Since the trend is linear in log scale, I estimate that the rate of growth should be alogN, where a is around 2. </br>
