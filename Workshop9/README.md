Check out Algorithms/Workshop9 from github.

1. Implement DoubleHashST.java according to the comment at the top of the file.
2. Run FrequencyCounter 8 < tale.txt using DoubleHashST. There should be 14,350 put() operations, as shown in the graphs on page 475 of the textbook.
  1. Reproduce the orange part of these graphs: graph the cumulative average number of equality tests up to the Nth put(), for each N.
  2. Keep track of which put() operations caused a resize() and which caused a rehash(). Mark them on the graph.
  3. Compare your graph to the graphs on page 475 and write down your remarks in a markdown document.

Add your graph and markdown to your branch.
