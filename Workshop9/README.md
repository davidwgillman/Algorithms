## Algorithms Workshop #9  

### November 2nd, 2017

Please see "DoubleHashST.java" for the implementation according to the comments at the top of the file.

1) Once I ran the code, I recieved a NullPointerException. Here is the following error message:  
**Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**at DoubleHashST.<init>(DoubleHashST.java:86)**   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**at DoubleHashST.<init>(DoubleHashST.java:63)**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**at FrequencyCounter.main(FrequencyCounter.java:20)**  
This is pointing to the code in the constructor of the DoubleHashST.  

2) I was not able to complete the second part of this workshop because of the nullpointer. :-(
