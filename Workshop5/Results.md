# Copy your commands and output here, clearly labeled.

Command: `javac KnuthShuffle.java`,
         `java KnuthShuffle`

Input size `N = 10,000`        
Output: `Time passed: 0.002`

Input size `N = 20,000`        
Output: `Time passed: 0.003`

Input size `N = 40,000`        
Output: `Time passed: 0.006`

Input size `N = 80,000`        
Output: `Time passed: 0.013`

# Write your answers to questions here, too.

### Time your algorithm on input arrays of size 10,000, 20,000, 40,000, and 80,000 and show the results in a table.

### Estimate the running time in the form aN^b using the doubling method.
Linear runtime: O(2N)

### Write a program to shuffle the array [1,2,3,4] 2,400 times, count how many times each shuffled version of the array comes up, and print the results. Show the results.

### Explain why the *invariant* in the demo is true: after round i, the array is uniformly shuffled from index 0 to index i. (Hint: use induction on i. The largest element in a uniformly shuffled array is equally likely to be in any position.)
